However, I can provide you with a simplified example of how you might structure the code for a crash detection system that uses displacement sensors, a transducer, and a simple severity determination.

Please note that a full implementation would involve hardware components, sensor calibration, and a 3D visualization system that is beyond the scope of this text-based response."""

"""n this simplified example:

We have classes representing the DisplacementSensor, Transducer, CrashDetectionSystem, and VehicleVisualizationSystem.

The DisplacementSensor class simulates sensor data, and the Transducer class simulates the conversion of the sensor data to an electrical signal.

The CrashDetectionSystem class uses the sensor and transducer to determine the accident severity based on a simplified calculation.

The VehicleVisualizationSystem class is a placeholder for visualizing the accident severity, but the actual 3D visualization would require additional complex libraries and hardware integration.

This example is a starting point for structuring your code. In a real-world application, you'd replace the simulated data and calculations with actual hardware interfaces and a 3D visualization system."""
